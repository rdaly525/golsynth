-Modify the API to implicitly include boundary
-Add toroidal wrapping options. Or mobius/klein bottle wrapping.
-Modify the alive/dead API to an 'up to K' number of valid counts.
    -Maybe even modify to an uninterpreted function
-Get the glider working
    -Figure out how to abstract the glider delta
-Prevent the synthesis of the same pattern. (all rotations. and other symmetries)
-Try out 3D or higher dimensions
    -Have 2 slices representing action on both sides
-Maybe encode larger patterns and use LUTS
